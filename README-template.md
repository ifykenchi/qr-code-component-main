## My process

I worked closely with the figma design. First I wrote the html for the full
project. Then I created the styles.css file where I worked from top to bottom in
styling the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Useful resources

I found these sites very helpful in writing the css for the project

- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
